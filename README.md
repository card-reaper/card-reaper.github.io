## Card art

Currently, the cards feature black and white pixel art. If you are interested in making your own card art, simply head to the [card art generator website](https://card-reaper.com/card-art-generator/), export your card art in json form, and email it to me at [ojgames112000@gmail.com](mailto:ojgames112000@gmail.com?subject=Custom%Card%Art). I would love to get your art and feature it on cards!
